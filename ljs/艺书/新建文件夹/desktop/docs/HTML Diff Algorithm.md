#Project Description

A library for comparing two HTML files/snippets and highlighting the differences using simple HTML.

This HTML Diff implementation is a C# port of the ruby implementation found [here](https://github.com/myobie/htmldiff).


# Usage

I have put together a blog post covering how to use the library. A simple demo is included with the solution.
